# WiFi-Band-Unequal-Split-Power-Divider

PCB Stripline RF Power Divider

• Design and simulation of an RF power divider based on PCB stripline technology following [Bailey’s version](https://github.com/cdcortesr/WiFi-Band-Unequal-Split-Power-Divider/blob/main/19800023177.pdf) to achieve unequal output power ratios at 2.45 GHz. 

• Simulation was performed using ADS (Advanced Design System) and CST Studio Suite for an output power of Pout1=2*Pout2.

•(drawing, s-parameters magnitude and phase, current density).
